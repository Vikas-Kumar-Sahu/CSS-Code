<!--
    In this example:

The default layout is a single column for smaller screens.
A media query is used to change the layout to two columns when the screen width is 600 pixels or more (@media only screen and (min-width: 600px)).
You can customize the breakpoints and styles within the media queries based on your specific design requirements.
This is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you would likely have more complex styles and possibly use frameworks like Bootstrap or Flexbox for more sophisticated responsive design.
